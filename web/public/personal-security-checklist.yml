  intro: >-
    Most reported data breaches are caused by the use of weak, default, or stolen passwords
    (according to [this Verizon report](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_dbir-2016-executive-summary_xg_en.pdf)).
    Use long, strong, and unique passwords, manage them in a secure password manager, enable
    2-factor authentication, keep on top of breaches, and take care while logging into your accounts.
  checklist:
  - point: Use a Strong Password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If your password is too short, or contains dictionary words, places, or names, then it can be easily
      cracked through brute force or guessed by someone. The easiest way to make a strong password is by
      making it long (12+ characters) — consider using a 'passphrase' made up of many words. Alternatively,
      use a password generator to create a long, strong random password. Have a play with
      [Security.org's How Secure Is My Password?](https://security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/), to get an idea of how quickly common
      passwords can be cracked. Read more about creating strong passwords:
      [securityinabox.org](https://securityinabox.org/en/passwords/passwords-and-2fa/).

  - point: Don't Reuse Passwords
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If someone were to reuse a password and one site they had an account with suffered a leak, then a
      criminal could easily gain unauthorized access to their other accounts. This is usually done through
      large-scale automated login requests, and it is called Credential Stuffing. Unfortunately, this is all
      too common, but it's simple to protect against — use a different password for each of your online accounts.

  - point: Use a Secure Password Manager
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      For most people, it is going to be near-impossible to remember hundreds of strong and unique passwords.
      A password manager is an application that generates, stores, and auto-fills your login credentials for you.
      All your passwords will be encrypted against 1 master password (which you must remember, and it should be
      very strong). Most password managers have browser extensions and mobile apps, so whatever device you are on,
      your passwords can be auto-filled. A good all-rounder is
      [Bitwarden](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers/bitwarden), or see
      [Recommended Password Managers](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers).

  - point: Avoid Sharing Passwords
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      While there may be times that you need to share access to an account with another person, you should
      generally avoid doing this because it makes it easier for the account to become compromised. If you
      absolutely do need to share a password — for example, when working on a team with a shared account — this
      should be done via features built into a password manager.

  - point: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      2FA is where you must provide both something you know (a password) and something you have (such as a
      code on your phone) to log in. This means that if anyone has your password (e.g., through phishing,
      malware, or a data breach), they will not be able to log into your account. It's easy to get started,
      download [an authenticator app](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#2-factor-authentication)
      onto your phone, and then go to your account security settings and follow the steps to enable 2FA. Next
      time you log in on a new device, you will be prompted for the code that is displayed in the app on your phone
      (it works without internet, and the code usually changes every 30 seconds).

  - point: Keep Backup Codes Safe
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you enable multi-factor authentication, you will usually be given several codes that you can use if
      your 2FA method is lost, broken, or unavailable. Keep these codes somewhere safe to prevent loss or
      unauthorized access. You should store these on paper or in a safe place on disk (e.g., in offline storage
      or an encrypted file/drive). Don't store these in your password manager as 2FA sources and passwords
      should be kept separately.

  - point: Use Hardware Security Keys
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      For maximum security, consider using hardware security keys like [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/) or 
      [Titan Security Key](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key). These physical devices provide the 
      strongest form of 2FA and are resistant to phishing attacks. They work by requiring you to physically 
      touch the key when logging in, making remote attacks impossible.

  - point: Sign Up for Breach Alerts
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      After a website suffers a significant data breach, the leaked data often ends up on the internet. Several websites collect
      these leaked records and allow you to search your email address to check if you are in any of their lists.
      [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com), [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com),
      and [DeHashed](https://dehashed.com) allow you to sign up for monitoring, where they will notify you if your
      email address appears in any new data sets. It is useful to know as soon as possible when this happens so
      that you can change your passwords for the affected accounts. [Have i been pwned](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/online-tools/have-i-been-pwned) also has domain-wide
      notification, where you can receive alerts if any email addresses under your entire domain appear (useful if
      you use aliases for [anonymous forwarding](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#anonymous-mail-forwarding)).

  - point: Shield your Password/PIN
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      When typing your password in public places, ensure you are not in direct line of sight of a CCTV camera and
      that no one can see over your shoulder. Cover your password or pin code while you type, and do not
      reveal any plain text passwords on your screen.

  - point: Update Critical Passwords Periodically
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Database leaks and breaches are common, and, likely, several of your passwords are already somewhere
      online. Occasionally updating passwords of security-critical accounts can help mitigate this. But providing
      that all your passwords are long, strong, and unique, there is no need to do this too often — annually should be
      sufficient. Enforcing mandatory password changes within organisations is [no longer recommended](https://duo.com/decipher/microsoft-will-no-longer-recommend-forcing-periodic-password-changes),
      as it encourages colleagues to select weaker passwords.

  - point: Don't Save your Password in Browsers
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Browser password managers are not as secure as dedicated password managers. They are often not encrypted,
      can be easily accessed by anyone with access to your device, and may sync passwords across devices insecurely.
      Use a dedicated password manager instead, which will provide better security and features.

  - point: Use Passphrases for Master Passwords
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      For your password manager master password, consider using a passphrase instead of a complex password.
      A passphrase is a series of random words that are easy to remember but hard to crack. For example:
      "correct horse battery staple" is much more secure than "P@ssw0rd123" and easier to remember.

  - point: Use Biometric Authentication
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Use biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) when available on your devices.
      This provides convenient and secure authentication, though it should be used in combination
      with strong passwords, not as a replacement.

  - point: Monitor Account Activity
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Regularly check your accounts for unusual activity. Look for login attempts from unknown
      locations, password changes you didn't make, or other suspicious activity. Many services
      provide activity logs in their security settings.

  - point: Use Account Recovery Options
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Set up account recovery options like backup email addresses or phone numbers. This helps
      you regain access to your accounts if you lose your primary authentication method.

  - point: Use Single Sign-On (SSO) Carefully
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      When using SSO services like Google or Microsoft accounts, be aware that compromising
      one account can affect access to multiple services. Use strong security on your SSO account.

  - point: Implement Account Lockout Policies
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      For critical accounts, consider implementing lockout policies that temporarily disable
      accounts after multiple failed login attempts. This helps prevent brute force attacks.
